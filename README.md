# GoOutside Project

## Project Overview
GoOutside isn’t the average startup. They’re seasoned adventurers with a loyal customer base and a rapidly expanding inventory, but their data is currently locked away in inaccessible systems. To untangle this mess, one can utilize BigQuery, Google Sheets, and Looker Studio. 
This repository contains work, including SQL queries, Google Sheets features, and Looker Studio dashboards, along with screen recordings of the process.

## BigQuery SQL
This folder contains the SQL queries used to create and analyze various datasets:
- Combined Sales Data
- Annual Sales
- Sales Drivers
- Total Sales

## Looker Studio
### Steps to Create Dashboards:
1. **Connect Your Data**
2. **Join Data Sources**
3. **Create Visualizations**
4. **Add Filters and Controls**
5. **Customize Layout**

## Screen Recordings
We have screen recordings available for:
- BigQuerySQL workspace
- Looker Studio workbench

These recordings provide a step-by-step guide to our data processing and visualization workflows.

## Google Sheets (Can be used as well)
### Features:
- **Pivot Tables**: Used for summarizing and analyzing data.
- **Column Status**: For tracking the status and updates of columns.
